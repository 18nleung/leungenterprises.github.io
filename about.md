I'm Nathan, lead web designer and developer at [Leung Enterprises](http://leung.enterprises/).

I enjoy making cool things using JavaScript and Node.js.  Visit my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/18nleung) to see a few things that I've made.

Some of my relevant skills include ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Jade.
